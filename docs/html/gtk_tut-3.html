<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Data Types</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a few things you probably noticed in the previous examples
that need explaining. The gint, gchar, etc. that you see are typedefs
to int and char, respectively, that are part of the GLlib system. This
is done to get around that nasty dependency on the size of simple data
types when doing calculations.
<P>A good example is "gint32" which will be typedef'd to a 32 bit integer
for any given platform, whether it be the 64 bit alpha, or the 32 bit
i386. The typedefs are very straightforward and intuitive. They are
all defined in glib/glib.h (which gets included from gtk.h).
<P>You'll also notice GTK's ability to use GtkWidget when the function
calls for an Object. GTK is an object oriented design, and a widget
is an object.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 More on Signal Handlers</A>
</H2>

<P>Lets take another look at the gtk_signal_connect declaration.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
gint gtk_signal_connect( GtkObject *object,
                         gchar *name,
                         GtkSignalFunc func,
                         gpointer func_data );
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Notice the gint return value? This is a tag that identifies your
callback function. As stated above, you may have as many callbacks per
signal and per object as you need, and each will be executed in turn,
in the order they were attached.
<P>This tag allows you to remove this callback from the list by using:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
void gtk_signal_disconnect( GtkObject *object,
                            gint id );
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, by passing in the widget you wish to remove the handler from, and
the tag returned by one of the signal_connect functions, you can
disconnect a signal handler.
<P>You can also temporarily disable signal handlers with the
gtk_signal_handler_block() and gtk_signal_handler_unblock() family of
functions.

better examples of callbacks. This will also introduce us to our next
topic, packing widgets.

<P>Compile this program using the same linking arguments as our first
example.  You'll notice this time there is no easy way to exit the
program, you have to use your window manager or command line to kill
it. A good exercise for the reader would be to insert a third "Quit"
button that will exit the program. You may also wish to play with the
options to gtk_box_pack_start() while reading the next section.  Try
resizing the window, and observe the behavior.
<P>Just as a side note, there is another useful define for
gtk_window_new() - <CODE>GTK_WINDOW_DIALOG</CODE>. This interacts with the
window manager a little differently and should be used for transient
windows.
